SVK_EXPENSE

Why does this exist?:

One day, the thought of me being very wasteful and impulsive with my purchases came to me

Since I'm still a bit of a brokie (for now), I figured an expense tracker would help me manage money better; 
setting a goal of $100< spent per month ðŸ¤”

Features: 

 - simple CRUD functionality to add 'expenses' with title, category, and amount
 
 - app tracks the date the expense was logged and displays expenses by month;
   with a summary page for total spending in each category and total spending for each month

Stack used: 

 PocketBase as a quick backend to store expenses; 
 Sveltekit for frontend; 
 Tailwind and SkeletonUI for styling;
 and of course, TypeScript
